# Trendeye iOS (Beta)
Graphic Design trend classification powered by CoreML via image data from [TrendList.org](https://www.trendlist.org)

## Screenshots

## Tech Stack
**Client:** Swift, UIKit, AVKit, CoreML

**Server:** TypeScript, Node, Express (mainly `JSDOM` for image scraping)

**Deployment:** Terraform, Docker, DigitalOcean (Ubuntu VPS)

## Notable Features
Trendeye is a simple app with a simple purpose, but contains some interesting UI/UX goodies built from scratch:

- Snapchat-style full-screen camera view input powered by AVKit (namely, `AVCaptureSession`)
- Instagram-style image panning and zooming (built by leveraging `UIPanGestureRecognizer` and `UIPinchGestureRecognizer` in tandem)
- Stretchy table headers (using a modified version of Michael Nachbaur's [solution](https://nachbaur.com/2020/05/06/stretchable-tableview-header/))

Most importantly, all this was accomplished using **zero** third-party libraries! Though, in some ways I wish I had used them as I found many bugs in UIKit along the way üåù

## Roadmap
- *Greatly* improve accuracy of the image classification model
- Implement photo framing and cropping using `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`
- Persist classification results on the device using CoreData or Realm and sync them with iCloud
