## Tech Stack

**Client:** Swift, UIKit (fully programmatic MVC, zero storyboards or nibs), AVKit, CoreML

**Server:** TypeScript, Node, Redis, Express (namely [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) and Node's [Stream API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream) for web and image scraping respectively)

**Deployment:** Terraform, Docker, Ubuntu (via DigitalOcean), NGINX

**Design:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator

## Notable Features

Trendeye is a simple app with a simple purpose and feature-set but contains some interesting UX goodies built from the ground up:

- Snapchat-style full-screen camera view input powered by AVKit (namely `AVCaptureSession`)
- Instagram-style image panning and zooming (leveraging `UIPanGestureRecognizer` and `UIPinchGestureRecognizer` in tandem)
- Stretchy table headers (using a modified version of Michael Nachbaur's very eloquent [solution](https://nachbaur.com/2020/05/06/stretchable-tableview-header/))

Most importantly, the above was accomplished without a single third-party dependency. Though, in some ways I wish I had used _some_ as I encountered a fair number of bugs in UIKit along the way üåù

## Roadmap

- **_Greatly_** improve the accuracy of the image classification model
- Implement photo framing and cropping using `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`
- Persist classification results locally on the device using CoreData and subsequently sync them with `CloudKit`
